# Answer:


# The previous 3 examples were to show that vectors can be represented
# as either 1D or 2D numpy arrays (lists or lists of lists). When doing matrix-vector
# multiplication, the resulting vector will have the same shape as the input vector.
# Either way is valid and yields the same result, just represented slighly differently.

# linear algebra operations using numpy.

# Answer:

# (T/F) Because a_column is a column vector, it did element-wise multiplication
# broadcasted across each column of M.

## Read the following when you are done with the above TODOs:

# Note: * does scalar or element-wise multiplication, while @ does matrix multiplication.

# Note: when doing matrix-vector multiplication where the vector is a 1D array,
# numpy will automatically treat the vector as a row or column vector based on
# the operation being performed. This is different from MATLAB where a vector
# is always treated as a column vector unless transposed.
# For example: vec @ matrix will treat vec as a row vector, while matrix @ vec
# will treat vec as a column vector.

# Note: when doing vector-vector multiplication with 1D arrays, numpy will always
# do a dot product. You can not do a @ a.T to achieve an outer product, instead
# you can use np.outer(a, a) to perform an outer product. Another possible
# vector-vector operation is a cross product, which can be done with np.cross(a, b).

# Note: when using vectors as 2D arrays, they are essentially matrices and @ operations
# should behave as you would expect from linear algebra if you pay attention the
# their shapes.
